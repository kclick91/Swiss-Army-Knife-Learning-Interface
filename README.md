# Swiss-Army-Knife-Learning-Interface
Interface based on the swiss army knife mental model.
This interface is for both individuals and teams.

## Steps for improving the Swiss Army Knife Interface
Step 1. Add method to interface
Step 2. Add method to implementation example
Step 3. Add method to Print All function
Step 4. Work on implementation

## Suggestions
1. Call preliminary functions in the class.
Ex. Function3(){Function1(); Function2()};
2. Test each function against more generalized and abstract algorithms. 

## Something Interesting
In Strategy(Tactic()) the use of a tactic is important and one needs to find a use for it. On the other hand, in Tactic(Strategy()) the tactic needs to be determined while the Strategy is already determined.
