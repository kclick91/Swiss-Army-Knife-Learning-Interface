# Swiss-Army-Knife-Learning-Interface
Interface based on the swiss army knife mental model.
This interface is for both individuals and teams.

## Steps for improving the Swiss Army Knife Interface
Step 1. Add method to interface
Step 2. Add method to implementation example
Step 3. Add method to Print All function
Step 4. Work on implementation

## Suggestions
1. Call preliminary functions in the class.
Ex. Function3(){Function1(); Function2()};
2. Test each function against more generalized and abstract algorithms. 

## Something Interesting
In Strategy(Tactic()) the use of a tactic is important and one needs to find a use for it. On the other hand, in Tactic(Strategy()) the tactic needs to be determined while the Strategy is already determined.

## Method Calls
        Implementation imp = new Implementation();
        imp.Store(); //store in memory
        imp.Synthesize(new Object(), new Object()); //synthesize
        imp.Decompose(new Object()); //decompose an object
        imp.Link(new Object(), new Object()); //Link separate objects
        imp.Categorize(new Object()); //Categorize objects
        imp.Detect(); //detect
        imp.Detect(new Object()); //detect something specific
        imp.UnderstandConsequences(); //look ahead
        imp.ExplainEvents(); //explain how or why something happened
        imp.ExplainItself(); //explain how it made a decision
        imp.ImproveSelf(); //Improve it's own algorithm
        imp.Calculate(); //General calculation
        imp.Train(); //Practice, train on data, inputs
        imp.Train(new Object()); //Practice with something specific
        imp.FindSimilarities(new Object(), new Object()); //find similarities
        imp.FindDifferences(new Object(), new Object()); //find differences
        imp.DefendDecision(new Object()); //Hold its ground
        imp.UseIntuition(); //Up to you
        imp.Imagine(); //Represent a fictional input
        imp.Teach(); //Teach humans or other AI
        imp.FindInsight(); //Be insightful
        imp.FindBias(); //Detect and return a name of a bias
        imp.FindFallacy(); //Detect and return a name of a fallacy
        imp.SeekReward(); //Learn from rewards
        imp.AvoidPunishment(); //Learn to avoid punishment
        imp.Translate(new Object()); //Translate languages or anything in general
        imp.Name(); //Come up with a name for a concept
        imp.Rate(); //Grade, rate with numbers, stars, etc.
        imp.Conclude(new String()); //Reason with input
        imp.TransferKnowledge(); //Transfer knowledge to another domain
        imp.PayAttentionTo(new Object()); //Focus
        imp.Understand(new Object()); //Works to store preparations for similar objects
        imp.Strategize(); //Strategy
        imp.UseTactic(new Object()); //Tactics
        imp.WriteAlgorithm(); //Update code
        imp.DoesUnderstand(new Object()); //User checks if something is understood
        imp.GiveBigPicture(); //Think holistically
        imp.ExpressABelief(new String()); //Returns whether a statement is true or false
        imp.WeighOptions(new Object(), new Object()); //returns 0 for first or 1 for second OR anything that is preferred
        imp.BlackBox(new String(), new String()); // Understand black boxes
        imp.ScrambleMethodsHierarchically();//Scramble the levels of hierarchy, In F(G()) F is higher in the hierarchy.
        imp.AssignValue(new Object());//Assigns value to something
